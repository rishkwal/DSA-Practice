# Asymptomatic Analysis

When we have two algorithms to solve the same problem:

1. It might be possible that for some inputs, first algorithm performs better than the second. And for some inputs, second performs better.
2. It might also be possible thatfor some inputs, the first works better on some machines and the second algorithms works better on some other machines.

Asymptomatic analysis handles these problems.
